# Vulnerable Application

All CA Infrastructure Management monitoring agents prior to 9.20 are vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability
within the nimcontroller when using the directory_list probe. Since the directory_list probe requires read privileges
the target host must also be vulnerable to CVE-2020-8010 to bypass ACL settings. Successful code execution will result
in a NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM shell, even if exploitation fails the remote service will not crash. You should be able to
exploit the service an unlimited amount of times.
