# Nimbust

The following is a proof of concept written to demonstrate the read/write bug that can be triggered when the target has improper ACL settings. Although the service may seem secure (e.g strict probe settings), if improperly configured we can reach ANY probe. There may be easier methods to gain RCE such as installing a malicious package however I haven't dug to much into it.

## Nimbust Usage

Usage is pretty straight forward, point and launch! You can also get a OS fingerprint before you try any of the read / write probes. Unfortunately this PoC will not be able to upload any NULL bytes as is, keep that in mind when exploiting a host.

```
root@kali:~# ./nimbust.py
usage: nimbust.py [-h] [-t TARGET] [-d DIRECTORY] [-f FILE] [-m MODE]

Nimbust - Nimbus exploitation toolkit

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TARGET, --target TARGET
                        Where to send the probe
  -d DIRECTORY, --directory DIRECTORY
                        Directory to get a listing from, or write to
  -f FILE, --file FILE  File to read or write
  -m MODE, --mode MODE  Exploit mode (read, write, list, fingerprint)
```

## Exploitation Example (Nimpack)

During initial research exploitation of CVE-2020-8010 was achieved via writing a `.bat` script to the Start-Up directory in Windows. However, [Fabius Artel](https://twitter.com/FabiusArtrel) found a more effective method using the `probe_change_par` and `probe_activate` probes as shown below.

## Exploitation Example (Nimbust)

Maintaining this exploitation method as it is still an easy exploitation pathway should you be targeting a Linux host. However, the easier and more effective method is using Nimpack.
